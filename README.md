# Telecom-Data-Migration-ETL-Mosul
A scalable ETL pipeline designed to clean, validate, and migrate telecom customer data (e.g., billing records, network usage, subscriptions) from legacy systems to a modern platform. Ensures data integrity, compliance with telecom standards, and seamless integration with downstream analytics tools.
